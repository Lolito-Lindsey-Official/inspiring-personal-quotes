Absolutely, Lolito. I'll compile your quotes into a text format that you can easily incorporate into your HTML/CSS project.

1. "Uncertainty is life’s constant. Adaptation is life’s elixir. It's antivenom dare I say. Once acknowledged, adjust your life little by little, moment by moment, and proceed bravely by confronting its enriching, ambiguous, and often chaotic nature. Your first draft does not demand perfection, but a commitment to being its founder and architect. Commit to building a better and more fruitful version of your life than the last. Being the sociable creatures that we are, don’t hesitate to establish camaraderie with those who propel you forward and make you feel human. Lead with the words: Quality, Intention, and Grace."

2. "Nothing is personal. People change when they see fit or when there’s a strong incentive to do so."

3. "I was the merchant of my own mental enslavement. I locked my own soul away."

4. "Emotions are meant to be shared in a safe and vulnerable setting. Just the two of us."
