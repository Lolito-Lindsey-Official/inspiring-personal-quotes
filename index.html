        <p>"Uncertainty is life’s constant. Adaptation is life’s elixir. It's antivenom dare I say. Once acknowledged, adjust your life little by little, moment by moment, and proceed bravely by confronting its enriching, ambiguous, and often chaotic nature."</p>
        <p>"Your first draft does not demand perfection, but a commitment to being its founder and architect. Commit to building a better and more fruitful version of your life than the last."</p>
        <p>"Being the sociable creatures that we are, don’t hesitate to establish camaraderie with those who propel you forward and make you feel human. Lead with the words: Quality, Intention, and Grace."</p>
        <p>"Nothing is personal. People change when they see fit or when there’s a strong incentive to do so."</p>
        <p>"I was the merchant of my own mental enslavement. I locked my own soul away."</p>
        <p>"Emotions are meant to be shared in a safe and vulnerable setting. Just the two of us."</p>
